NSFetchedResultsController : NSObject, NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate

    /* Notifies the delegate that a fetched object has been changed due to an add, remove, move, or update. Enables NSFetchedResultsController change tracking.
    	controller - controller instance that noticed the change on its fetched objects
    	anObject - changed object
    	indexPath - indexPath of changed object (nil for inserts)
    	type - indicates if the change was an insert, delete, move, or update
    	newIndexPath - the destination path for inserted or moved objects, nil otherwise
    	
    	Changes are reported with the following heuristics:
    
    	On Adds and Removes, only the Added/Removed object is reported. It's assumed that all objects that come after the affected object are also moved, but these moves are not reported. 
    	The Move object is reported when the changed attribute on the object is one of the sort descriptors used in the fetch request.  An update of the object is assumed in this case, but no separate update message is sent to the delegate.
    	The Update object is reported when an object's state changes, and the changed attributes aren't part of the sort keys.
